        Hello! My name is Gianna Lanfrank. I am a Graphic Design Major interested in curating graphics and designing websites. I also have a minor in Sociology, which appeals to my interests in discussing the criminal justice system and how society stigmatizes and oppresses impoverished and minority groups. One of my proudest accomplishments is making it onto the Dean's List in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse every semester since I stepped on campus. I have also received the Newhouse Leadership Scholarship in recognition of my extensive involvement in honor societies and extracurriculars at my high school. Furthermore, I have skills in creative writing, copy editing, utilizing Adobe Apps, customer service, and more. 
Outside of school, I enjoy cooking and going to the beach. I live four blocks from the ocean on the Jersey shore, so saying I’ve spent most of my life on a beach is an understatement. I would love to get into more beach-related activities beyond tanning and swimming, but I am unfortunately uncoordinated. I can’t say that I have a favorite movie or tv show, but I am currently watching Suits on Netflix – which I am enjoying much more than I previously assumed. It has shown me a different perspective of the justice system that has further fueled my passion in advocating for those who have been wrongfully accused and/or silenced. 
In the future, I would love to find a balance between my interest in graphic design and activist work. Designing graphics to educate those on the injustices people face, or being a creative director for an organization aimed at helping underprivileged groups are two possibilities that I see myself pursuing.
