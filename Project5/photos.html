    <p>
        This portfolio was crafted during a photography class that I had taken during my Fall 2023 semester at Syracuse. I wanted to show that every photo I have taken, no matter the project or premise, aligns with an overall tone or theme that I consistently (and unknowingly) fell back to. My images tended to lean towards something graphic, and my professor used to say, “I can always tell who are the graphic designers in my classes”. I had an eye for shadows and angles, as well as patterns and shapes; something you will see throughout the page. Although I had never held a camera in my hands prior to taking this class, I was determined to become proficient in camera skills in order to be able to express myself creatively in a new way; and to set me apart from other designers who maybe do not know how to take and edit photos. I improved every week, and am very proud of how much effort I put into this course and all of the amazing work that came out of it. 

        For my final portfolio, I wanted to exhibit my favorite images from throughout the semester. My intention was to give you an idea as to who I am as a designer, and show you how seeing things from a different perspective can create something really interesting. Whether in black and white or color, intentional or candid, every image speaks to the fact that what occurs naturally in the world is all that is needed to make something beautiful. I hope you enjoy this collection of works as much as I enjoyed making it for you.
