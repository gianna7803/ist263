    <h1>Gianna Lanfrank's Photography Portfolio</h1>

        <p>Hello! My name is Gianna Lanfrank. I am a Graphic Design Major interested in designing graphics and websites. I also have a minor in Sociology, which appeals to my interests in discussing the criminal justice system and how society stigmatizes and oppresses impoverished and minority groups. One of my proudest accomplishments is making it onto the Dean's List in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University every semester since I stepped on campus. I have also received the Newhouse Leadership Scholarship in recognition of my extensive involvement in honor societies and extracurriculars at my high school. Furthermore, I have skills in creative writing, copy editing, utilizing Adobe Apps, photography, and more. In the future, I would love to find a balance between my interest in graphic design and activist work. Designing graphics to educate those on the injustices people face, or being a creative director for an organization aimed at helping underprivileged groups are two possibilities that I see myself pursuing.<br><br>Although design is my main focus, I picked up a skill in photography this past year as well. Thus, I wanted to show off my collection of photos that arenâ€™t particularly design-focused, but show off my eye for design and details in the natural world. I hope you enjoy!</p>
